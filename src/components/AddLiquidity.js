      <p>
        When you provide liquidity to a pool (e.g., an ETH/DAI pool), you usually need to deposit an equal value of both assets. For example, if you want to add $1,000 worth of liquidity to an ETH/DAI pool, you would need to provide $500 worth of ETH and $500 worth of DAI. This ensures that the pool remains balanced and can facilitate trades between the two assets without causing significant price slippage.
      </p>

      <h3>Maintaining the Pool Ratio:</h3>
      <p>
        The value of the assets in the pool needs to remain proportional to facilitate smooth trading. If liquidity providers were allowed to add just one asset, it could lead to an imbalance, making the pool less effective for trading and potentially causing significant price swings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some platforms and protocols support single-sided liquidity provision. In these cases, you might be able to add just one asset to the pool. However, when you add a single asset, the protocol might automatically swap half of it for the other asset in the pair, ensuring the pool remains balanced. This can involve paying additional swap fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        (maybe delete this also) Balancer, a different kind of automated market maker (AMM), allows for multi-asset pools with custom weightings. In Balancer pools, you can add liquidity with a single asset, and the protocol will rebalance the pool accordingly. This flexibility comes with the cost of potential impermanent loss and swap fees as the pool adjusts to maintain its balance.
      </p>

      <h3>Stablecoin Pools:</h3>
      <p>
        Some platforms offer pools for stablecoins (e.g., Curve Finance), where the assets are stable relative to each other. These pools might have more flexibility in terms of adding liquidity with a single stablecoin, as the assets maintain a relatively stable value.
